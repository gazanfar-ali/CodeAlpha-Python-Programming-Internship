## 🏅 My Learnings at CodeAlpha

During my internship at CodeAlpha, I gained valuable hands-on experience in:

- **Core Python Programming:** Strengthened my grasp of loops, conditions, functions, file handling, and data structures through practical coding exercises.
- **Project Structuring:** Learned how to break down larger problems into manageable, well-documented mini-projects suitable for sharing on GitHub.
- **Professional Documentation:** Developed clear, organized README files to present my projects professionally.
- **Problem-Solving:** Sharpened my logical and analytical skills by building solutions from scratch and debugging code independently.
- **Portfolio Building:** Understood the importance of clean code, reusable components, and readable documentation for technical portfolios.

CodeAlpha’s collaborative and project-oriented environment inspired me to experiment, iterate, and grow into a more confident Python developer ready for real-world challenges.
